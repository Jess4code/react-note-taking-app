# React Note-Taking Application

This project is a simple note-taking application built in ReactJS. You can create, edit, and delete notes. Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing them to persist across sessions.

## Credits

This project was inspired by the YouTuber [EGATOR](https://www.youtube.com/@EGATORTUTORIALS). Special thanks to him for providing a tutorial and guidance on building this application. You can watch the tutorial on his channel: [React Notes App Tutorial for Beginners 2023 | React JS Beginner Project Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3ooazcK4TI).

## Notes

While I took inspiration from the tutorial above, I implemented my own CSS styles, state management, and added a few additional touches to make the project unique.

### Libraries

1. **react-router-dom** - For handling client-side routing in the application.
2. **react-icons** - To easily include popular icons in the app.
3. **uuid** - For generating unique IDs for the notes.
